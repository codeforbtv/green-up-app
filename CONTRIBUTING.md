# Contributing Code


## First Steps

1) **Phone a friend**: The first step is always to chat up folks on [#green-up][3] on Slack. Visit our channel [here][4] or if it's your first time, get an invitation [here][5].

2) **Get a Dev Environment Running**: Our "Full Local Environment" setup is up to date as of 03 April 2022. 

3) **Check the Project Board**: We have our open software tickets organized under [projects](https://github.com/codeforbtv/green-up-app/projects). If you're new to the project, look for those labeled as ['good first issue'](https://github.com/codeforbtv/green-up-app/labels/good%20first%20issue).

4) **Dial Tech Support**: If you have trouble at any point we have a dedicated slack channel for that.  Join the [#tech-support](https://codeforbtv.slack.com/messages/tech-support/) channel and someone will help you out asap.

5) **Get to work!** See [How to Contribute Your Work](#How-to-Contribute-Your-Work) below.

## Environment Setup

### A Full Local Environment

1) **Get a Config File**: You won't be able to run the code without a firebase-config.js file. The fastest approach is to use our shared dev environment (..which we share, so please treat it kindly). There is one pinned to the [#green-up Slack channel][3] for our dev environment. If you have trouble finding it, just ask anyone in the channel. Save your firebase-config.js in the root of the project.

1) **(Optional) Use Your Own Firebase Account**: Setup a Firebase app and use those app settings to configure firebase-config.js,    
Get your own Firebase database here (https://firebase.google.com/) or, if you want to contribute to this project, find us on [Slack][4] and we'll gladly share ours. Not on our Slack board?  [Get an invitation.][5]

2) **Ensure you have `nvm` installed**: Do this by running `nvm ls`. If you see a list of `node` versions printed to your console, then you're all set. Otherwise, follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

3) **Install Project Dependencies**:
`.nvmrc` file should drive the correct node version to use without specifying it explicitly.

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
# optional nvm alias green-up v18.19.1
yarn install
# flow
npm install -g flow
# or
yarn global add flow
```

4) **Download the Expo App**: The Green Up app is configured to be run on your physical phone inside the Expo mobile app (aka the "Expo Client"). Expo is a shell that runs the unpublished mobile app.
    * [Download for iPhones][1]
    * [Download for Android][2]

5) **Start the Application**: Run the project in the root folder.

```bash
npx expo start
# or
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

6) **Profit!** When the giant QR code appears in the editor...
    * **iPhones**: point your camera at the QR code and the app will launch in expo
    * **Android**: open the Expo mobile app and click "Scan QR Code"

    This will open the app on your phone. Now create an account and begin exploring!
